### Interests

My main intersts are:

* React: Since it's part of my daily work and has been a big area I've invested time in. I'm particulary interested in Server Side Rendering, React Server Components, and performance.
* Game dev: I've done a few projects with GameMaker, Unity, and Monogame.
* ML + DL: I've done projects with ML and DL in the past, so this is always an interesting area to work on.
* Anything: I'm always open to work on something new!

### Hobbies

Outside work I love to:

* Outdoors: Go on outdoors adventures such as hiking or climbing on real rock.
* Climbing: I love to climb indoors and outdoors, though I mainly get to do it indoors. Gotta keep the fingers strong to type strong code ;).
* Video games: I love to play video games, mainly interested in single players games (Stardew Valley has been my favorite for the past few years).
